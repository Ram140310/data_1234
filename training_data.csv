23,19591,Training Quality,Feedback on Python Programming Sessions with Trainer Nikhil,"Hi DataMites Team, I am writing to provide feedback on the recent Python programming sessions conducted by Trainer Nikhil. Firstly, I would like to acknowledge that Trainer Nikhil completed the Python programming sessions on 10th December 2023 which started on 26th November. His knowledge of the subject matter was evident, and it was clear that he is well-versed in Python. However, I would like to share some concerns regarding the pace and interaction during the sessions. The pace at which Trainer Nikhil conducted the sessions was quite fast . We initially thought he might be a substitute for Priyanshu for just a week, but it seems that he has completed the module. While his speed may have suited those with a strong technical background, a significant portion of the class, including myself, comes from a non-technical background. This made it challenging for me to keep up with the material. Furthermore, it would have been beneficial if Trainer Nikhil had considered the diversity of the class. Over 60% of the participants are from non-technical backgrounds, and their learning needs differ from those with a technical background. Despite his expertise, Trainer Nikhil's approach to questioning and interaction during the sessions seemed to leave many students, aside from 1-2, who were promptly answering the moment he was introducing the next topic. This lack of engagement may have resulted from the pace and the technical depth of the material. I believe that a more inclusive and measured teaching approach would have been appreciated by the majority of the class. Slowing down the pace and ensuring that questions are accessible to students with varying levels of technical expertise could greatly enhance the learning experience for everyone. I understand that different trainers have unique teaching styles, and I appreciate the effort put into delivering the sessions. However, considering the diverse background of the participants, a more balanced and inclusive teaching approach would be beneficial for future sessions. I hope this feedback contributes to the continuous improvement of the training program.

I paid the full amount for the CDS online course  and later requested a reschedule to due to unforeseen circumstances. Mr. Pradeep, my learning counselor, initially offered assistance with the rescheduling process. However, he later provided an incorrect online link for a different course. Despite repeated attempts to reach out to Mr. Pradeep via phone and messages, he was unresponsive and completely ignored my communication. I subsequently escalated the issue to your help desk, sending multiple emails that looped Mr. Pradeep in. Despite this, I received no clear response from either Mr. Pradeep or anyone else at your institution. To my further disappointment, my ticket was abruptly closed without any explanation or resolution. This lack of communication and disregard for my concerns left me feeling frustrated and disrespected. Now, after a period of 6-7 months, I receive a message from Mr. Pradeep informing me about a refresher course for previous students. This message is not only insensitive to the inconvenience and distress I experienced but also raises serious doubts about your institution's commitment to customer service. Furthermore, I urge you to review your internal processes and communication protocols to prevent similar situations from occurring in the future.

As the weekday batch is not yet started, you can enroll me for this weekend timing batch, but later once the weekday batch starts do shift me to the weekdays batch. 1 more request, as of now only recordings of previous sessions have been shared which is too long to watch in one go, can you make available resources like ppt, codebooks, or reference material used in training to complete and practise those topics before training starts.

392,18857,Certification,,"Dear Datamites, I trust this email finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a few concerns I have encountered during my time in the training program. I appreciate the efforts made by the institution, but I feel it is important to highlight some deviations from the commitments made during the orientation and joining process. Firstly, during the orientation, there was a clear mention that mock interview training would be provided to enhance our preparation. However, to my surprise, we were directed to participate in direct mock interviews without any prior training. This has left many of us feeling unprepared and has impacted the overall effectiveness of the interview preparation process. Secondly, there was an initial assurance that the institution would actively contribute to the process of resume building. Unfortunately, this has not been the case as we received only five sample resumes and were asked to prepare our own. This contradicts the initial understanding that the institution would play a more hands-on role in guiding us through this crucial aspect of the job search process. Lastly, I would like to express my concern about the placement status of the first batch, to which I belong. As of now, none of us has secured a placement, and this has caused anxiety and uncertainty among the participants. I understand that the job market can be challenging, but it would be helpful to receive more guidance and support during this critical phase. I believe that addressing these concerns will contribute to the overall success and satisfaction of the participants.

I am writing to address a concern regarding my batch enrollment, and despite my previous attempts through emails, the issue remains unresolved. I attended a mock interview yesterday and have successfully completed all module exams and job-ready assessments. However, it has come to my attention that my name is currently enrolled in two batches, likely stemming from my rejection for CDS in February 2023 ( 27-Feb-23-CDS-WDE-ONL) and  subsequent acceptance in May 2023(15-May-23-CDS-BUN-021-WDM09-BAN). And i am getting communication in both the batches. J think because of this even PAT team is sending me multiple messages irrespective of attempting all modules tests and mock interviews. I would like to bring to your notice that I joined in the month of May 2023. I have sent multiple emails seeking assistance in changing my batch designation, but unfortunately, the matter has not been resolved. I kindly request your prompt attention to rectify this situation, adjusting my batch to accurately reflect my enrollment date of May 15, 2023 to avoid confusion . I believe verification of attendance sheets will confirm my participation in the correct timeframe. My correct batch code is ""15-May-23-CDS-BUN-021-WDM09-BAN.""

562,18770,PAT Resume template,,"Subject: Concerns and Feedback on Training Program Dear Datamites, I trust this email finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a few concerns I have encountered during my time in the training program. I appreciate the efforts made by the institution, but I feel it is important to highlight some deviations from the commitments made during the orientation and joining process. Firstly, during the orientation, there was a clear mention that mock interview training would be provided to enhance our preparation. However, to my surprise, we were directed to participate in direct mock interviews without any prior training. This has left many of us feeling unprepared and has impacted the overall effectiveness of the interview preparation process. Secondly, there was an initial assurance that the institution would actively contribute to the process of resume building. Unfortunately, this has not been the case as we received only five sample resumes and were asked to prepare our own. This contradicts the initial understanding that the institution would play a more hands-on role in guiding us through this crucial aspect of the job search process. Lastly, I would like to express my concern about the placement status of the Second batch, to which I belong. As of now, none of us has secured a placement, and this has caused anxiety and uncertainty among the participants. I understand that the job market can be challenging, but it would be helpful to receive more guidance and support during this critical phase. I believe that addressing these concerns will contribute to the overall success and satisfaction of the participants. I am open to discussing these matters further to find collaborative solutions that will benefit both the current batch and future participants.

632,18767,Training Quality,Concerns and Feedback on Training Program,"Dear  Datamites, I trust this email finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a few concerns I have encountered during my time in the training program. I appreciate the efforts made by the institution, but I feel it is important to highlight some deviations from the commitments made during the orientation and joining process. Firstly, during the orientation, there was a clear mention that mock interview training would be provided to enhance our preparation. However, to my surprise, we were directed to participate in direct mock interviews without any prior training. This has left many of us feeling unprepared and has impacted the overall effectiveness of the interview preparation process. Secondly, there was an initial assurance that the institution would actively contribute to the process of resume building. Unfortunately, this has not been the case as we received only five sample resumes and were asked to prepare our own. This contradicts the initial understanding that the institution would play a more hands-on role in guiding us through this crucial aspect of the job search process. Lastly, I would like to express my concern about the placement status of the first batch, to which I belong. As of now, none of us has secured a placement, and this has caused anxiety and uncertainty among the participants. I understand that the job market can be challenging, but it would be helpful to receive more guidance and support during this critical phase. I believe that addressing these concerns will contribute to the overall success and satisfaction of the participants. I am open to discussing these matters further to find collaborative solutions that will benefit both the current batch and future participants. Thank you for your attention to these concerns, and I look forward to your prompt response.
